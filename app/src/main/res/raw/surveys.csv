I'm using AAC encodec b/c storage estimate was best.

Recording seems to start second or couple after I answer call.

Reasons I use this program are: no ads, required permissions (no need for network, etc.), available options, open source.

Add help for file name custom format. I had to search %X-""variables"" from sourcecode. It was ok for me, but not for normal user.

Could you keep also few older change logs visible in play store? Version number and changes in that version.

If things keep working like now, I could consider a donation :)"

Can you make your app to be able to read other files other than created by your app? Eg: .wav, .mp3, .amr, .awb, .vmo.

I want to suggest to implement an audio compressor in this case to kinda bring the lower volumes up in order to make mic records sound more audible. It may also raise the noise, but i think this may be a nice improvement. Thanks, this piece of software is awesome. Comtact me if you want at heitordrpATgmailDOTcom"
